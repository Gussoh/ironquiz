Four software together creates the setup for a Jeopardy-like game. One server, one bigscreen, one client and an arbitrary number of pulpits for the contestants.

Each contestant has a laptop with the screen turned away from them and then uses a mouse as a "buzzer".

There is no support for "the final question".
